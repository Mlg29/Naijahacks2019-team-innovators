# Problem
### Solid waste management is one of the environmental challenges faced by urban and rural dwellers in Nigeria. More than 32 million tons of solid waste are produce annually out of which less than 30% is collected by relevant agencies. This accounts for $8 billion – about 35% of the country’s 2018 budget, while Lagos accounts for 10,000 tons of solid waste daily, which translates to a value chain of about $2 billion per year in Lagos alone. The problems due to inefficient waste management is due to the following:

- Inadequate environmental policies and legislation for solid waste collection
-  Inadequate facilities for solid waste management (management deficiencies)
- Responsible for a number of communal diseases (Serious environmental impact)
-  Collection efficiency of the existing solid waste management system is very low
- Development authorities are not able to offer analogous type of solid waste management system for different communities, due to diverse lifestyles in communities.

# Solution
- We are developing a platform that offer an efficient office and household recycling service. Collected wastes are later processed to our collection Hubs and therefore sold to manufacturing/recycling companies who make use of these raw materials for the production of a variety of items.

# Proposed Stack
- Node, ReactJs,Express, MongoDB

# Benefit
- Eco-friendly and efficient management of wastes
- Means of employment to the teeming population of Nigerian youths
- Attains MDG Target of Ensuring environmental sustainability
- Reduce the number of communal diseases caused of inefficient waste management
